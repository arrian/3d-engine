  // Constructor. Creates a bird of type NORMAL with the given dimensions,
  // initial position, and velocity.
  // bDimensions.{x,y,z} = {length, width, height}

  virtual bool update(const double &elapsedSeconds);  
  // Updates this object based on the amount of elapsed time since the last
  // update, and the previous acceleration and velocity.
    
  double maxVelocity;
  // [m/sec] Maximum magnitude of velocity. Default value is 10

  double maxAcceleration;
  // [m/(sec^2)] Maximum magnitude of acceleration as a fraction of
  // maxVelocity. Default value is 0.5 
  
  double cruiseDistance;
  // [m] Desired distance from closest neighbor when flying. Default value
  // is twice the bodylength.

  double roll;
  // [radians] Rotation around body-local z-axis (+roll =
  // counterclockwise). Default value is 0.

  double pitch;
  // [radians] Rotation around body-local x-axis (+pitch = nose tilting
  // upward). Default value is 0.

  double yaw;
  // [radians] Rotation around body-local y-axis (increasing
  // counterclockwise, 0 is along body-local +z). Default value is 0. 

  static ObstacleList obstacles;
  // Linked list of obstacles that every boid will try to avoid. By default
  // there are no obstacles. If you add an obstacle to this list, _all_
  // boids will see it (because it's a static member).
  
protected:

  virtual double getGravAcceleration(void) const;		
  // Returns the magnitude of gravitational acceleration in the (0, -1, 0)
  // direction [m/(sec^2)]. 

  virtual double accumulate(Vector &accumulator, Vector valueToAdd);
  // Given an accumulator and a value to add to the accumulator, this
  // method truncates the magnitude of valueToAdd so that, when added to the
  // accumulator, the magnitude of the accumulator is at most 1.0. It then
  // adds the truncated value to the accumulator. The value returned is the
  // magnitude of the accumulator after the addition. 

  virtual double getProbeLength(void);
  // Returns how far in front of boid to probe for obstacles. By default,
  // the probe length scales linearly from 10 times bodylength to 50 times
  // bodylength as the boid accelerates from 0 m/s to maxVelocity.

  virtual double desiredCruisingSpeed(void);
  // Returns the speed the boid would like to travel at when not under any
  // other influences (i.e., obstacles, flocking desires, etc). The default
  // value is 1/5 of maxVelocity.
  
  virtual void calculateVisibilityMatrix(void);
  // Each boid helps maintain a visibility matrix, which is an NxN matrix,
  // where N is the current number of boids (it is dynamically expanded each
  // time a new boid is created). Each cell [A,B] represents whether boid A can
  // see boid B. The contents of the matrix are described further in the
  // visMatrix macro in boid.c++
  // The reason for this matrix is to drastically reduce the computational
  // complexity of determining which boids are visible to the others.
  
  virtual int visibleToSelf(Boid *b);
  // Returns 1 if this boid can see boid b, 0 otherwise.
  
  virtual void calculateRollPitchYaw(Vector appliedAcceleration,
				     Vector currentVelocity,
				     Vector currentPosition);
  // Calculate the roll, pitch, and yaw of this boid based on its
  // acceleration, velocity, and position. Though position isn't necessary
  // for most approximations of attitude, it may be useful in some
  // circumstances. 

  virtual Vector levelFlight(Vector AccelSoFar);
  // Returns a vector which indicates how the boid would like to accelerate
  // in order to fly level (i.e., with minimal pitch). 
  
  virtual Vector wander(void);
  // Returns a vector which indicates how the boid would like to accelerate
  // when not under any other influences. Related to desiredCruisingSpeed().

  virtual Vector collisionAvoidance(void);
  // Returns a vector which indicates how the boid would like to accelerate
  // in order to avoid collisions with non-boid obstacles.

  virtual Vector resolveCollision(Vector pointOnObject, Vector normalToObject);
  // Called by CollisionAvoidance, this method attempts to avoid a collision
  // with a specific obstacle, and returns an acceleration vector indicating
  // how the boid should accelerate to achieve this end.

  virtual Vector maintainingCruisingDistance(void);
  // Returns a vector which indicates how the boid would like to accelerate
  // in order to maintain a distance of cruiseDistance from the nearest
  // visible boid. 

  virtual Vector velocityMatching(void);
  // Returns a vector which indicates how the boid would like to accelerate
  // in order to fly at approximately the same speed and direction as the
  // nearby boids.

  virtual Vector flockCentering(void);
  // Returns a vector which indicates how the boid would like to accelerate
  // in order to be near the center of the flock.

  virtual Vector navigator(void);
  // This method prioritizes and resolves the acceleration vectors from
  // CollisionAvoidance(), FlockCentering(), MaintainingCruisingDistance(),
  // VelocityMatching(), Wander(), and LevelFlight(). It returns the actual
  // acceleration vector that the boid will apply to its flight in the
  // current time step.
  
  virtual int getBoidType(void) const;
  // Returns the type of this boid. 
  
  double bodyLength;
  // [m] Length of the boid. By default this value is equal to the z
  // component of the bDimensions passed to the constructor.

  double time;
  // [sec] current time				

  int boidNumber;
  // Unique integer identifying the number of this boid. The first boid
  // created is given boidNumber 1, and the values increase sequentially.

  char bName[50];
  // Name of self. This is used by the ObjectList data structure. The
  // constructor sets this equal to "boidX" where X is the boidNumber. 

  bool flockSelectively;
  // Should this boid flock only with boids of the same boidType, or with
  // all boids? The default value is FALSE, meaning that this boid will
  // flock with all boids regardless of type.
  // Basically, should boids of a feather stick together? :)
  
  int boidType;
  // Identifies the type of boid for selective flocking

  static ObjectList boidList;
  // A boid is added to this list when its constructor is called. All boids
  // have access to this list, and use it to determine where all the other
  // boids are. 

  static int **visibilityMatrix;
  // See description in CalculateVisibilityMatrix() and the comments for the
  // visMatrix macro for more info.
  
  static int boidCount;	
  // Total number of boids that have been created so far. Note that this
  // value increases monotonically, and does NOT take into account boids
  // that have been deleted.
  
private:
